New Trier Block Schedule App

## Project Description

A coworker mentioned that he was having trouble adapting to New Trier High School's new block schedule. He asked me to build him a simple app that helped him know which class period it was. I decided it would be a good case use for learning how to build an iOS Widget. After building the app for his and I's personal use, word spread throughout the school that the app existed. Eventually, administration approached me about making the app available to all students, parents, and teachers. The app was originally built in Swift in late 2021, early 2022. It was rebuild in Flutter in summer 2022 after the school requested an Android version.

This app contains platform specific code for iOS so that users can add a home screen widget.
